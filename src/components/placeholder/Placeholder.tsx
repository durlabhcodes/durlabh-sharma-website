After multiple failed attempts at learning CSS, I finally gave up the thought of designing a website and planned to learn app development. I believed that steering clear of CSS will solve all my problems. But, to my surprise, once again I was in the same position. Actually, even worse. This time I had the technical knowledge unlike the case with CSS. That’s when it struck me that it’s not the CSS. Problem is that I’m not able to think in terms of UI Design. And I spent past few months to fix that part of my dumb brain. Finally I have decided to get my hands dirty and try with absolute rock bottom. As a result, you’re looking at this totally raw web page with no design skills involved.  */}
